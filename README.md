A classic Pong game created using Java programming language, leveraging the java.awt and javax.swing libraries
for GUI development. <br/>
•I used an object oriented approach separating the components of the game into different classes. <br/>
•I implemented event listeners to capture user input for paddle control, enabling smooth and responsive
gameplay. <br/>
•Managed collision detection and response to enhance the realism of ball movement <br/>
